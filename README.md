# LinkedIn Learning Video Downloader

I like to keep local copies of the courses that I watch on LinkedIn Learning.

I usually use the tool [knowbee/llvd](https://github.com/knowbee/llvd) to do this, but sometimes it fails. It's too focused on the end result, that is downloading the videos.

I'll be taking a more layered approach to automating this process. So a fail at some layer shouldn't affect the end goal. If one is able to watch the videos, then one should be able to download them no matter what.
